EUPHiO BBS
==========

### Preamble

For a while now I've been wanting to revive the BBS I ran as a teenager.

There's some really amazing projects out there, like [ENiGMA½](https://enigma-bbs.github.io), and [Syncronet](https://www.synchro.net), but none of them really
scratched the itch for some reason. Maybe that's a personal issue, and that's what I'm exploring I guess.

I decided to start this project to learn Go at a much deeper level, and as a way to grow personally and professionally.
It's pretty nerdy, I get that. The telnet spec is pretty archaic and I wasn't even sure if I wanted to support it, but 
I wanted to try, and this is what I ended up with.

If I end up creating something that others can use and that contributes to a community that I sit on the outskirts of,
that would be awesome too. I can say that the project is currently heavily, heavily inspired by ENiGMA½ (and the amazing
and impressive body of work by Bryan Ashby/NuSkooler) at least in execution. The intent is to remain on the simplistic
side though, and allow the sysop to build out more functionality if they want to.

A big portion of my background is in Rails, and so I have a strong value for providing frameworks for others to expand
on, and that's what I'd like to try to achieve here as well.

The gadget is, I think, what a lot of people vaguely foresaw as the crowning achievement of civilization: an electronic something-or-other, cheap, easily mass-produced, that can, at the flick of a switch, provide tranquility. I see you have one here.<br/></br>- The Euphio Question, Kurt Vonnegut (Welcome to the Monkey House)
